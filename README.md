# Seat Selection of a Movie Theater 🎥
💡Setup a project folder and create the index.html, style.css and script.js files.🎭

In this project I am creating a seat selector UI for a movie theater. We will have a dropdown picker to select a movie, a legend to display if a seat is vacant, selected, or already reserved, a drawing of a theater and also some text to display the number of seats selected by the user and the total cost of the tickets.👓

Project Requirements🚩
- Select the movie choices and seats in a theater in order to purchase tickets.🎫
- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info.🖥️
- User can select a movie/price.💸
- User can select/deselect seats..💺✔️
- User can not select occupied seats. 🈯
- Number of seats and price will update.🆕
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh.👀
